## Language Identification

###Dataset

WiLI 2018: The WiLI-2018 dataset contains 235 classes. Those classes
include 122 Indo-European languages, 22 Austronesian languages, 17 Turkic languages, 14 Uralic languages, 11 NigerCongo languages, 10 Sino-Tibetan languages, 9 Afro-Asiatic
languages, 6 constructed languages and 24 languages of smaller
families.

### Model

Character Level CNN: Characters used as features for the convolutional
neural network model.


### How to Run

```python3 main.py```

You can check the main.py file for the arguments allowed and change
them as necessary during the runtime.

### Results

Accuracy: 80.6%

### Future work
Try LSTM network or a combination of CNN RNN.
